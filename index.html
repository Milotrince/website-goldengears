                HOW GOLDEN GEARS STARTED
The Golden Gears started out as a FIRST Lego League team in August, 2012 in La Canada, California.  We are a community team working out of a garage. We have worked together as a team over the past 5 years and have learned a lot about teamwork, researching solutions to problems, gracious professionalism, NXT as a platform, robot form and function, and good design principles. While an FLL team, we were awarded trophies for programming, robot design and the robot game; and Champions Trophy two times in a row at qualifying tournaments.


Over the summer of 2015, we decided to try FTC as our next challenge. To get to know the new materials and platform of a larger robot, we assembled the PushBot and a half-court for practicing in our garage. While putting together PushBot, some team members showed interest and skill in robot assembly while others decided (that after the Kickoff) to pursue the programming, robot driving, and support roles like managing the Engineering Notebook and outreach.
